# Customer-Segmentation

Customer segmentation is done on a UK based online store, that sells unique all occasion gifts. A recency, frequency and monetary analysis (RFM) is used to segment customers.

The project is completed in 5 steps:
1. Data Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Data Transformation
4. Clustering
5. Cluster Profiling

With the elbow method and silhouette analysis, 3 clusters is found to be the optimum number of cluster for the KMeans clustering model.

The 3 clusters formed are names as:
1. High value and loyal customers.
2. Average value and ordinary customers.
3. Low value and casual customers.
